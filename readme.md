## Vue Api Layer example

A basic Api Layer to do requests to services, they could be local, external or cloud services.

You can see examples using a basic fetch request, and then going further by using axios with
a better structured syntax to create Api request to services.

```
# install dependencies
yarn
or
npm install

# run locally
yarn dev
or
npm run dev
```
